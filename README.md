# Hiro-Hackathon-Counter

This is my first entry for the Hiro October Hackathon. In this REPO I have built out an expanded version of the basic counter. Along with incrementing and decrementing, I am storing the calling principal for retrieval. An issue I've run into is using `unwrap!` as I get an error of two different execution paths. I would like to investigate this more so I can throw an error when there is no principal specified for `last-setter` but may move on to a new challenge.
